## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Federico, and I'm just an italian guy who's enthusiastic about Computer Vision and Computer Science overall. 

Here's in my GitHub profile you'll find some of the projects I've been working on and that I want to share. Some of them are just personal and class projects dating back to the college years, others may be just personal experiments to learn new things. 

**Please enjoy!**
